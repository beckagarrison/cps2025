# 🚀 EASIEST WAY TO DEPLOY - VERCEL CLI

## ⚡ THE PROBLEM

You're in Figma Make (browser), so you can't run git commands directly on this code.

## ✅ THE SOLUTION: VERCEL CLI

Deploy directly from Figma Make to Vercel, then connect to GitHub!

---

## 📥 STEP 1: INSTALL VERCEL CLI

**Open terminal on your computer and run:**

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

**Or if you don't have npm:**

Download and install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org
Then run the command above.

## 🔐 STEP 2: LOGIN TO VERCEL

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to sign in with your GitHub account (FIGHTCPS2023).

## 📂 STEP 3: DOWNLOAD YOUR CODE

Since you're in Figma Make, we need to get your code onto your computer.

**Ask me:** "How do I get the code from Figma Make to my computer?"

And I'll provide a zip file or alternative method!

## 💡 BEST METHOD FOR YOU

Since you can't export from Figma Make easily, let's use this approach:

**I'll create a downloadable package for you, or we'll use Vercel's web interface to deploy directly.**

**Ask me:** "Create download package" and I'll prepare everything!
