### **Motion to Dismiss** (excerpt):

```
IN THE DISTRICT COURT
FOR HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS

IN THE INTEREST OF:                    §
                                        §    CAUSE NO. 2024-12345
JANE DOE, JOHN DOE,                     §
                                        §
CHILD/CHILDREN                          §    HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS

MOTION TO DISMISS

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:

NOW COMES Sarah Smith, appearing pro se, and respectfully 
moves this Court to dismiss the above-captioned matter in 
its entirety, and in support thereof would show the Court 
as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

This matter involves allegations of abuse or neglect against 
Sarah Smith regarding the minor children, Jane Doe and John Doe. 
Sarah Smith respectfully submits that the Department has failed 
to meet its burden of proof and that this case should be dismissed 
for the following reasons.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
United States Constitution, the government must prove allegations 
of abuse or neglect by clear and convincing evidence. Santosky v. 
Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982). This heightened standard of 
proof reflects the fundamental liberty interest that parents have 
in the care, custody, and control of their children. Troxel v. 
Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000).
