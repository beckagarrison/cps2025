matter in its entirety...

I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF RELIEF SOUGHT

     Mary Smith respectfully moves this Court to dismiss 
the petition filed by the Department regarding the minor 
children, Jane Doe (age 5) and John Doe (age 7). As 
demonstrated below, the Department has failed to meet 
its burden of proof, violated constitutional rights, and 
failed to comply with statutory requirements...

II. LEGAL STANDARD FOR DISMISSAL

     A. Burden of Proof

     Under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution and 
applicable California law, the State must prove 
allegations of abuse or neglect by **clear and 
convincing evidence**. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 
745, 769 (1982)...

     B. Fourth Amendment Violation - Unreasonable 
Search and Seizure

     The caseworker violated the Fourth Amendment by 
entering Mary Smith's home without a valid search 
warrant, voluntary consent, or exigent circumstances. 
Gates v. Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory 
Services, 537 F.3d 404 (5th Cir. 2008). "The right of 
parents to raise their children without undue government 
intrusion is a fundamental liberty interest protected by 
the due process clause."...

WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Mary Smith respectfully 
prays that this Court:
