## 🔧 FEATURE GATING STRATEGY

### **How to Enforce Tiers:**

```typescript
// Check subscription before allowing feature

function canAccessFeature(feature: string): boolean {
  const tier = user.subscription_tier; // 'free' | 'premium' | 'attorney'
  
  const permissions = {
    free: ['basic_violations', 'timeline', 'rights_guide'],
    premium: ['ai_analysis', 'defense_strategy', 'podcast', 'binder'],
    attorney: ['case_law', 'litigation_tools', 'multi_state'],
  };
  
  if (tier === 'attorney') return true; // Attorney gets everything
  if (tier === 'premium' && permissions.premium.includes(feature)) return true;
  if (permissions.free.includes(feature)) return true;
  
  return false;
}

// Before expensive AI call:
if (!canAccessFeature('ai_analysis')) {
  showUpgradePrompt('Premium plan required for AI document analysis');
  return;
}
```

### **Usage Limits:**

```typescript
// Track usage and enforce limits

interface UsageLimits {
  documents_per_month: number;
  ai_requests_per_day: number;
  exports_per_month: number;
}

const LIMITS = {
  free: {
    documents_per_month: 3,
    ai_requests_per_day: 0, // No AI on free
    exports_per_month: 1,
  },
  premium: {
    documents_per_month: 999,
    ai_requests_per_day: 50,
    exports_per_month: 999,
  },
  attorney: {
    documents_per_month: 9999,
    ai_requests_per_day: 200,
    exports_per_month: 9999,
  },
};

// Before document upload:
if (user.documents_this_month >= LIMITS[user.tier].documents_per_month) {
  showUpgradePrompt(`Upgrade to Premium for unlimited documents!`);
  return;
}
```

---

## 📈 CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION

### **Free → Premium Conversion Tactics:**

**1. Strategic Limitations:**
- Free users hit limit at critical moment (after uploading 3 docs)
- Show what they're missing (AI analysis grayed out with "Premium" badge)
- Tease premium features ("Upgrade to see AI-generated defense strategy")

**2. Upgrade Prompts:**
```

## 🎁 TRIAL STRATEGY

### **7-Day Free Trial (Premium Only):**

**Why it works:**

## 💡 PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

### **Why $19.99 Works:**

1. **Under $20 threshold** - Feels affordable
2. **Less than 1 hour with attorney** ($300-500)
3. **Daily cost: 66¢** - "Less than a coffee"
4. **Monthly subscriptions** - Familiar (Netflix, Spotify)
5. **Cancel anytime** - Low commitment fear

### **Anchoring Strategy:**

```
Show this order on pricing page:

┌─────────────────────┐
│  ATTORNEY SUITE     │  ← Expensive anchor
│  $99/month          │
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────┐
│  PREMIUM ⭐ POPULAR │  ← Feels like great deal
│  $19.99/month       │
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────┐
│  FREE               │  ← Low value perception
│  $0/month           │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Result:** Most users choose Premium (middle option)
